# Basics

Kotlin is compiled to Java bytecode, which provides the backward compatability. When wishing to see Kotlin in real-life
J2K converter can be used to convert part of source code into Kotlin. Another way is to start writing unit tests in
Kotlin.

Kotlin standard library is just Java standard library and a bunch of extensions which provides very smooth
interoperability between Java code and Kotlin code.

In `IntelliJ` we can use the `Show Kotlin bytecode` + `Decompile` features to see the Java alternative for the Kotlin
code.
