# Hashing

## Operations complexity

| Operation                  | Hash Map / Hash Set |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Adding an element          | *O(1)               |
| Deletion                   | O(1)                |
| Checking if element exists | O(1)                |
| Modifying element          | O(1)                |
| Retrieving an element      | O(1)                |

`*O(1)` amortized time complexity for adding to a HashMap / HashSet is caused by the need to resize
the underlying array when the load factor is reached

## What are hash maps

A hash map is an unordered data structure that stores key-value pairs. A hash map can add and remove
elements in O(1), as well as update values associated with a key and check if a key exists, also in
O(1)

## Why not an array?

Hash maps are just easier/cleaner to work with. Even if your keys are integers, and you could get
away with using an array, if you don't know what the max size of your key is, then you don't know
how large you should size your array.
With hash maps, you don't need to worry about that, since the key will be converted to a new integer
within the size limit anyway

## Why array instead of hash map?

* The biggest disadvantage of hash maps is that for smaller input sizes, they can be slower due to
  overhead. Because big O
  ignores constants, the O(1) time complexity can sometimes be deceiving - it's usually something
  more like O(10) because
  every key needs to go through the hash function, and there can also be collisions
* Hash tables can also take up more space

## Sets

It uses the same mechanism for hashing keys into integers. The difference between a set and hash
table is that sets do not map their keys to anything. An important thing to note about sets is that
they don't track frequency. If you have a set and add the same element 100 times, the first
operation adds it and the next 99 do nothing

## Checking for existence

One of the most common applications of a hash table or set is determining if an element exists in
constant time

Anytime we find our algorithm running `if ... in ...`, then we should consider using a hash map or
set to store elements to have these operations run in O(1)

Simple problem example:

> Given an array of integers nums and an integer `target`, return indices of two numbers such that
> they add up to `target`. You cannot use the same index twice.

```java
class Solution {

    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> dic = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int num = nums[i];
            int complement = target - num;
            if (dic.containsKey(complement)) { // This operation is O(1)!
                return new int[]{i, dic.get(complement)};
            }
            dic.put(num, i);
        }

        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }
}
```

## Counting

By "counting", we are referring to tracking the frequency of things. This means our hash map will be
mapping keys to integers. Anytime you need to count anything, think about using a hash map to do it

Simple problem example:

> You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Find the length of the longest substring that
> contains at most `k` distinct characters

```java
public int findLongestSubstring(String s, int k) {
    Map<Character, Integer> counts = new HashMap<>();
    int left = 0;
    int ans = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
        char c = s.charAt(right);
        counts.put(c, counts.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        while (counts.size() > k) {
            char remove = s.charAt(left);
            counts.put(remove, counts.getOrDefault(remove, 0) - 1);
            if (counts.get(remove) == 0) {
                counts.remove(remove);
            }

            left++;
        }

        ans = Math.max(ans, right - left + 1);
    }

    return ans;
}
```

## Count the number of sub-arrays with an "exact" constraint

* We use curr to track the prefix sum
* At any index `i`, the sum up to `i` is `curr`. If there is an index `j` whose prefix
  is `curr - k`, then the sum of the subarray with elements from `j + 1` to `i`
  is `curr - (curr - k) = k`
* Because the array can have negative numbers, the same prefix can occur multiple times. We use a
  hash map counts to track how many times a prefix has occurred
* At every index `i`, the frequency of `curr - k` is equal to the number of sub-arrays whose sum is
  equal to `k` that end at `i.` Add it to the answer

Problem example:

> Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the number of sub-arrays whose sum is equal
> to `k`

```java
class Solution {

    public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> counts = new HashMap<>();
        counts.put(0, 1);

        int ans = 0;
        int curr = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            curr += num;
            ans += counts.getOrDefault(curr - k, 0);
            counts.put(curr, counts.getOrDefault(curr, 0) + 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

The `curr` can be used to track prefix sums differently based on a given problem. For example, if
the problem required to give the number of sub-arrays with exactly `k` odd numbers we could do the
following

```java
curr += num % 2;
```

Instead of just tracking the regular prefix sum

```java
curr += num;
```

## Counting with more difficult examples

> Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together
> For example, given `strs` = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"],
> return [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

```java
class Solution {

    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> groups = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(arr);
            String key = new String(arr);

            if (!groups.containsKey(key)) {
                groups.put(key, new ArrayList<String>());
            }

            groups.get(key).add(s);
        }

        return new ArrayList(groups.values());
    }
}
```

> Given an integer array `cards`, find the length of the shortest sub-array that contains at least
> one duplicate. If the array has no duplicates, return `-1`

```java
class Solution {

    public int minimumCardPickup(int[] cards) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> dic = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
            int num = cards[i];
            if (dic.containsKey(num)) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, i - dic.get(num) + 1);
            }

            dic.put(num, i);
        }

        if (ans == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            return -1;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

> Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum value of `nums[i] + nums[j]`, where `nums[i]`
> and `nums[j]` have the same digit sum (the sum of their individual digits). Return `-1` if there
> is no pair of numbers with the same digit sum

```java
class Solution {

    public int maximumSum(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> dic = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = -1;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int digitSum = getDigitSum(num);
            if (dic.containsKey(digitSum)) {
                ans = Math.max(ans, num + dic.get(digitSum));
            }

            dic.put(digitSum, Math.max(dic.getOrDefault(digitSum, 0), num));
        }

        return ans;
    }

    public int getDigitSum(int num) {
        int digitSum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            digitSum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }

        return digitSum;
    }
}   
```

> Given an n x n matrix grid, return the number of pairs (R, C) where R is a row and C is a column,
> and R and C are equal if we consider them as 1D arrays

```java
class Solution {

    public int equalPairs(int[][] grid) {
        Map<String, Integer> dic = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] row : grid) {
            String key = convertToKey(row);
            dic.put(key, dic.getOrDefault(key, 0) + 1);
        }

        Map<String, Integer> dic2 = new HashMap<>();
        for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
            int[] currentCol = new int[grid.length];
            for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
                currentCol[row] = grid[row][col];
            }

            String key = convertToKey(currentCol);
            dic2.put(key, dic2.getOrDefault(key, 0) + 1);
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (String key : dic.keySet()) {
            ans += dic.get(key) * dic2.getOrDefault(key, 0);
        }

        return ans;
    }

    public String convertToKey(int[] arr) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int j : arr) {
            sb.append(j);
            sb.append(",");
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
